Investigating CRY hypothesis specifically - MOTIVATION: if true, could this be used to influence neuronal dynamics?
Can Cryptochrome radical pair mechanism be validated using spin inversion** ? 
can that have a measurable effect on the reaction kinetics and downstream signalling?

what is the best model tissue/culture/organism to study it in? what recording (optical - which? / electrophysiology - which?) is best suited? 

constraints - B0 (static field - negligible on recording, but possible distortion due to e.g. objectives) B1 - recording artifacts - filtering? blanking?\

radical pair mechanism - yes/no?
corroborating others' results

whre to study it - in vivo? in vitro? transgen?   -which organism?                                <-zebrafish retina mount/whole cell clamp?
how to record - electrophys - pipette/MEA? (electromag artifacts?), optical (slow?)

parameters - HFC, spin-spin, ??? - what other?
  which accessible via B1 - what coil/antenna??? proximity required/other considerations
  which B0 range?? are there any interesting regions?
