Investigating CRY hypothesis specifically - MOTIVATION: if true, could this be used to influence neuronal dynamics?
Can Cryptochrome radical pair mechanism be validated using spin inversion** ? 
can that have a measurable effect on the reaction kinetics and downstream signalling?

what is the best model tissue/culture/organism to study it in? what recording (optical - which? / electrophysiology - which?) is best suited? 

constraints - B0 (static field - negligible on recording, but possible distortion due to e.g. objectives) B1 - recording artifacts - filtering? blanking?
